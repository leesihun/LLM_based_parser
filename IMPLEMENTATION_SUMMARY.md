# Enhanced LLM System Implementation Summary

## ✅ Completed Features

Based on the requirements in CLAUDE.md, I have successfully implemented all requested features:

### 1. Setup Preparation ✅

  - Combines all files into `combined_data.md`
  - Handles Korean filenames and content properly
  - Creates clean table structures with proper escaping

### 2. RAG System ✅
- **RAG Implementation** (`src/rag_system.py`)
  - Uses ChromaDB for vector storage and retrieval
  - Intelligent text chunking with overlap for better context
  - Metadata extraction for improved search results
  - Persistent storage in `chroma_db/` directory
  - Search and context generation for LLM queries

### 3. Web UI Enhancements ✅
- **Enhanced Interface** (`index_enhanced.html`)
  - **RAG Search Button** - Enables RAG-powered conversations
  - **Document Reading Button** - Direct Q&A with combined markdown file  
  - **File Analysis Button** - Upload and analyze individual files
  - Modern, responsive design with mode indicators
  - Real-time status display

### 4. File Management System ✅
- **File Handler** (`src/file_handler.py`)
  - **File Upload Capability** - Drag & drop or click to upload
  - **Multi-format Support**: PDF, DOCX, XLSX, TXT, MD, code files
  - **File Reading** - Automatic content extraction based on file type
  - **User-based Storage** - Files organized by user ID
  - **Security** - File validation, safe filename generation

### 5. Server API Enhancements ✅
- **New API Endpoints** (added to `server.py`)
  - `/api/rag/search` - Search using RAG system
  - `/api/rag/chat` - Chat with RAG context
  - `/api/document/read` - Read combined markdown document
