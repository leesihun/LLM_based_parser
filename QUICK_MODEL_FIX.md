# Quick Model Configuration Fix

## Problem Fixed ✅
The system was trying to validate your model against a detected list, but now it will **use exactly the model you specify** in the configuration.

## Changes Made:

1. **OllamaClient now uses your configured model directly** without validation
2. **Model detection failures won't block usage** 
3. **Clear logging** shows which model is being used

## To Use Your Specific Model:

### Option 1: Update config/config.py
```python
# In config/config.py, change this line:
self.default_ollama_model = "YOUR_EXACT_MODEL_NAME"

# Examples:
self.default_ollama_model = "llama3"
self.default_ollama_model = "llama3:8b" 
self.default_ollama_model = "mistral"
self.default_ollama_model = "gemma2:9b"
self.default_ollama_model = "qwen2:7b"
```

### Option 2: Set Environment Variable
```bash
export DEFAULT_OLLAMA_MODEL="your_model_name"
```

### Option 3: Pass Model Name Directly
When creating OllamaClient:
```python
client = OllamaClient(default_model="your_model_name")
```

## What Happens Now:

1. **System starts** → Uses your configured model name
2. **Model detection fails** → System continues anyway
3. **LLM query** → Uses your exact model name
4. **Ollama handles it** → Auto-pulls if needed, or uses existing model

## Log Messages You'll See:

```
INFO: Using configured model: your_model_name
INFO: Using model: your_model_name
```

Instead of:
```
ERROR: Found 0 available models
```

## Quick Test:

1. Make sure your model name is correct in `config/config.py`
2. Run your application
3. Look for "Using model: YOUR_MODEL_NAME" in the logs
4. The system will work with whatever model you specify

The system now **trusts your configuration** and uses exactly the model you ask for, without trying to validate against a detected list.
